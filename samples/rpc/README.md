Remote Procedure Call sample for [peote-net](https://github.com/maitag/peote-net).

## Build with OpenFL

To build a gui application with [OpenFL framework](https://github.com/openfl)  
choose a `<target>` (neko, linux, windows, html5, android) and  

build and run a server:
`openfl test openflProject.xml -Dserver <target>`
