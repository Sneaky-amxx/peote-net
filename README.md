### peote-net
haxe api to use joint-protocol of [peote-server](https://github.com/maitag/peote-server)

written in [Haxe](http://haxe.org). Uses [OpenFl/Lime](http://www.openfl.org/documentation/setup/install-haxe/)
to run on multiple hardware devices.

If using this for web -> look into samples inside html5-test folder.
There is some peoteNetBridge.swf embed, that wrapps around flash-raw-sockets.

To test out Samples you will need a running TCP-Socket Server written in Perl:
